A toy dependently typed lambda calculus based language.

This is my take on how to write a simplement dependent type checker, which I will enrich over time. The following sections will be worked on :

1. [an untyped lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus)
2. [a simply typed lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simply_typed_lambda_calculus)
3. [the lambda cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube)
